# Welcome

In today's session of this MESA summer school we will explore the binary module!
In particular we will consider cases where the binary system consists of a star
with a companion black hole, which is modeled as a point mass. This lab has been 
designed for use with MESA version 22.05.1.

Credit for this lab also goes to those who carefully tested it before today!
